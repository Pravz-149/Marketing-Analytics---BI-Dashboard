# Marketing-Analytics---BI-Dashboard
Maven Analytics Challenge- Marketing Analysis Dashboard

Maven Analytics conducted a challenge - Maven Marketing Challenge where they added a rich dataset to their Data Playground with data from marketing campaigns involving 2240 customers. This is the first time I participated in a Maven Analytics challenge. Working on this challenge was a great experience for me, and it helped me fine-tune my Data Analysis and Power BI skills. Have a sneak peek at the dashboard before getting started!!!

## Overall goal:
You're a marketing analyst and you've been told by the Chief Marketing Officer that recent marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. You need to analyze the data set to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Are there any null values or outliers? How will you wrangle/handle them?
- Are there any variables that warrant transformations?
- Are there any useful variables that you can engineer with the given data?

## Answer the questions
- Which marketing campaign is most successful?
- What does the average customer look like for this company?
- Which products are performing best?
- Which channels are underperforming?

## Summary of actionable findings
- The most successful advertising campaign was the most recent campaign (column name: Response), and was particularly successful in Mexico (>60% acceptance rate!)
Suggested action: Conduct future advertising campaigns using the same model recently implemented in Mexico.
- The best-performing channels are web and store purchases (i.e. the average customer made the most purchases via these channels)
Suggested action: Focus advertising campaigns on the more successful channels, to reach more customers
- Advertising campaign acceptance is positively correlated with income and negatively correlated with having kids/teens
Suggested action: Create two streams of targeted advertising campaigns, one aimed at high-income individuals without kids/teens and another aimed at lower-income individuals with kids/teens
- The most successful products are wines and meats (i.e. the average customer spent the most on these items)
Suggested action: Focus advertising campaigns on boosting sales of the less popular items
