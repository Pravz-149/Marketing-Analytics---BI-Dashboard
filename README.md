# Marketing-Analytics---BI-Dashboard
Maven Analytics Challenge- Marketing Analysis Dashboard

Maven Analytics conducted a challenge - Maven Marketing Challenge where they added a rich dataset to their Data Playground with data from marketing campaigns involving 2240 customers. This is the first time I participated in a Maven Analytics challenge. Working on this challenge was a great experience for me, and it helped me fine-tune my Data Analysis and Tableau skills.

Let me start with a description of the dataset.

The data set contains data from the marketing campaign of 2,240 customers of Maven Marketing.

The challenge requires assuming the role of a newly hired BI consultant for Maven Marketing, a small digital marketing agency. Their latest marketing campaigns have underperformed, and they have brought you in to analyze their data and propose a solution.

Our task was to pitch a #1 recommendation to improve the impact of future marketing campaigns and show the analysis to support it.
